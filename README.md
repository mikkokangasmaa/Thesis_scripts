**Thesis Scripts**

A collection of scripts used during the development of my thesis. All were not included in the final work, however they could serve a purpose in fetching data. 

**Scripts Overview**

**1. Jalki Scrape**

Description: Web scraping script to download mountain biking route data from www.jalki.fi.

Note: The data was not used in the final thesis but provides a good starting point for web scraping from similar sites.

**2. RidewithGPS API**

Description: Script to access route information from the Ride with GPS API.

Requirements: An API access token, which can be requested from the Ride with GPS website.
